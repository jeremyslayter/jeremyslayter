### Jeremy Slayter, Medical Student, Casual Biostatistics and medical statistics. 

<h1> About Me </h1>

<p>Casual code typically in R and RStudio, developing additional expertise as I work on additional projects. Previous experience in <b> data wrangling </b> (R, Shell, Command Line, PERL), <b> Data Analysis </b>, <b>Data Visualization </b>, and most recently <b> geo-computation and network analysis </b> in R.</p>

<p>Currently I am studying neuromuscular diseases, although I am exploring the ability for improved modelling in medicine, application of machine learning/AI technology to rehabilitation, and improving patient outcomes/monitoring.</p>

<h1> Why GitHub? </h1>

This is primarily a <b>storage space </b> for me to catalog the code and scripts I have developed over time. I also use this space to learn from others as I troubleshoot my own projects. All of my code will be held privately unless I identify a purpose to share code (eg. Publication with data sharing).
