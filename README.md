### Jeremy Slayter, Medical Student, Casual Biostatistics and medical statistics. 

#About Me
Casual code typically in R and RStudio, developing additional expertise as I work on additional projects. Previous experience in data wrangling (R, Shell, Command Line, PERL), Data Analysis and Visualization, and most recently geo-computation and network analysis in R. 

Currently I am studying neuromuscular diseases, although I am exploring the ability for improved modelling in medicine, application of machine learning/AI technology to rehabilitation, and improving patient outcomes/monitoring. 

##Why GitHub?
This is primarily a storage space for me to catalog the code and scripts I have developed over time. I also use this space to learn from others as I troubleshoot my own projects. All of my code will be held privately unless I identify a purpose to share code (eg. Publication with data sharing).
